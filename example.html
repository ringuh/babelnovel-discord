        <body><div class="VOMEUTWT">In order to let Xiao Jiu'an beat her own mouth, the Devil Sect people arrogantly said: "Alright, we will wait for ten days. Let's see where you will transfer the army to Black Stone Mountain ten days later."</div><span id="EBLMLJJJ">Chapter 20 - Consecutive Slashes</span><p id="GIECVCOI">"Haha, I finally understand!"</p><span class="NLPJQQSG">Qin Feng laughed loudly, his voice was akin to a thunderclap, and at that instant, the aura exuding from his body underwent a drastic change.</span><div id="TNNJCLEW">"Ground-shattering Godly Fist! "Break!"</div><div id="SHQBMHAP">"This is impossible!"</div><p id="ZOLBTUNB">"The Holy Maiden that I've taught is not someone that anyone can touch." When the people from the Demon Sect heard that Xiao Jiu'an was here for Ji Xin, they were not surprised at all.</p><div class="OBPZUAMA">The middle-aged man's expression instantly changed. He didn't understand why this ant-like youth would suddenly erupt with such an astonishing aura.</div><span class="RCWWYDBO">"Your Highness, those of us from the Sun Moon Sect are not people to be scared. Although we are people from the martial arts world, we are not people who can do nothing. If His Royal Highness could transfer the military power without permission, he would not have come alone to the Black Stone Mountain. " The person hidden in the shadows mocked.</span><div class="QWHXODAN">BOOM!</div><div id="GOBGKMAE">Its aura was like a mountain, earth-shaking!</div><p class="PTPEMYAY">The people from the Demon Sect did not want to offend Xiao Jiu'an, but they were not afraid of him either.</p><span class="QCRKFBWT">A figure with boundless power appeared in the man's line of sight.</span><p id="BJTMADFT">"It's indeed time to end this!"</p><p class="YSGKLBTF">After all, this was someone else's territory, and this place was very strange. Although they didn't see anything abnormal, they didn't dare to guarantee that the other party didn't use any underhanded methods.</p><span id="ZNFUASYS">There was a trace of coldness in Qin Feng's tone. An aura that was invincible erupted once again!</span><p id="RBRVEDGV">This cold Qi actually gave rise to a strong air current, as if there was an expert from the Archaeozoic era piercing the ground with a punch.</p><span id="ITFFUPEU">Of course, this was not the main reason why the Three Kingdoms did not take action. The main reason why the Three Kingdoms ignored this place was because they didn't have much use for this place.</span><div class="QWHXODAN">The two serpentine forms of true qi were blasted away like thin paper by the force of the punch.</div><span class="RCWWYDBO">This kind of place was easy to breed crimes, but the Three Kingdoms had never thought of taking it down. With this place separating the Three Kingdoms, it would serve as a buffer against crime and not cause any trouble at the border.</span><div id="TNNJCLEW">Next.</div><span class="YHNYTRPE">Under the middle-aged man's shocked and terrified gaze, an incomparably domineering fist fiercely smashed over with a speed that was unable to react.</span><p class="RCLVJVVD">"Bam!"</p><p id="OUBWYTLV">An astonishing explosion shook the air, causing ripples to appear.</p><p class="DMQSIJOE">"No …" "That's impossible!"</p><span class="YHNYTRPE">The middle-aged man stared wide-eyed, with wisps of blood popping out from his bloodshot eyes. He stared at Qin Feng in disbelief. His lips moved, but he didn't have the strength to say anything else.</span><span id="ASBFIGDB">"Prince Yanbei, don't force us to attack!" The boss had been beaten to the point of bleeding. He gritted his teeth in anger, but did not dare to make a move.</span><div class="XYGTOIID">There was a huge bloody hole on his chest, and blood kept flowing out.</div><div id="MJLGQFBU">No matter how he struggled, he couldn't stop his life force from slipping away. He could only fall to the ground slowly in fear and despair, completely devoid of any signs of movement.</div><span class="AHUIXJSA">Xiao Jiu'an was clear about the situation around Black Stone Mountain and the people from the Devil Sect were clear as well. Hearing the threat in Xiao Jiu'an's words, they did not put him in their hearts at all.</span><span id="BIEUBSRM">"Not bad!"</span><p class="AERZWTQJ">"She is the third lady of the Ji Mansion. This king has come under the orders of the Emperor to bring her back to the capital." As for whether the emperor had said it or not, that was not important at all. In any case, the people from the Devil Sect would not listen to the emperor's orders.</p><span id="EBLMLJJJ">Qin Feng nodded in satisfaction.</span><p id="SLKNFLQX">At this moment, he could completely feel the change in his body. It was a fundamental change.</p><span class="QCRKFBWT">Every inch of his body was filled with power, and this power was mixed with a vast and boundless aura.</span><span class="WMONOTXP">Chapter 567 - Reconciliation</span><div class="JRDSVJJH">This momentum, it should be meant!</div><div class="VOMEUTWT">In order to let Xiao Jiu'an beat her own mouth, the Devil Sect people arrogantly said: "Alright, we will wait for ten days. Let's see where you will transfer the army to Black Stone Mountain ten days later."</div><p id="UPXPEBNB">Meaning was a type of mysterious thing.</p><span id="BIEUBSRM">The path of martial arts was to draw upon the spirit energy of heaven and earth for cultivation and combat. And the so-called "will" was to let the martial practitioner use it even more to the extreme.</span><span class="RCWWYDBO">This kind of place was easy to breed crimes, but the Three Kingdoms had never thought of taking it down. With this place separating the Three Kingdoms, it would serve as a buffer against crime and not cause any trouble at the border.</span><p class="XIFKQCFH">According to the types of weapons, there were sabers, spears, sticks, sticks, fists, palms … And so on.</p><span class="AHUIXJSA">Xiao Jiu'an coldly snorted in disdain, "A mob actually dares to spout nonsense in front of this king. This king will give you ten days. After ten days, this king will not be able to see Ji Xin.</span><p class="YIXBSQAK">What Qin Feng comprehended earlier, belonged to the fist intent!</p><span class="AHUIXJSA">Not only Xiao Jiu'an, even Ji Yunkai had noticed it, but there was more than one person lurking around, so they could not let down their guard and took action on their own.</span><p class="DMQSIJOE">The will of the Ground-shattering Godly Fist, was a kind of overbearing and tyrannical, using the strongest power to directly crush the opponent, the will to destroy everything!</p><div id="MJLGQFBU">"The Ground-shattering Godly Fist's fist intent is too terrifying. I just comprehended a little of it, but my strength has increased by a large amount!"</div><div class="FYTOPQMK">Qin Feng's eyes revealed joy, as he became even more expectant of the strength of the Ground-shattering Godly Fist.</div><span class="RCWWYDBO">"Your Highness, those of us from the Sun Moon Sect are not people to be scared. Although we are people from the martial arts world, we are not people who can do nothing. If His Royal Highness could transfer the military power without permission, he would not have come alone to the Black Stone Mountain. " The person hidden in the shadows mocked.</span><p id="SZOLKJFB">In the dark and gloomy uncultivated forest, there was a desolate and rotten smell everywhere. Especially after the gentle breeze blew, the smell was even worse.</p><span class="HQNPWEHQ">This timid person was even smaller than a needle. He truly didn't seem like a man.</span><div class="XQOQCCWN">"Swoosh swoosh swoosh!"</div><p id="ZOLBTUNB">"The Holy Maiden that I've taught is not someone that anyone can touch." When the people from the Demon Sect heard that Xiao Jiu'an was here for Ji Xin, they were not surprised at all.</p><div id="OHFRZSHX">All of a sudden, a figure dashed past swiftly like a bolt of lightning, ten meters in a single step. True energy shrouded his body, and the condensed true energy shattered all the trees.</div><span class="EBSMEAZX">"It is too much to just tear your sect apart. If This King wants you to hand Ji Xin over, doesn't that mean This King is relying on his strength to bully others?" After speaking for so long, Xiao Jiu'an finally confirmed the other party's location.</span><div class="QWHXODAN">"Little bastard, come out if you dare!"</div><p class="KRMHLFEG">This area was connected to three other countries. It could be considered a triangular area, and each country had troops stationed at the border of the triangular area. However, there weren't many people in this area.</p><p class="RCLVJVVD">The man roared at the sky. His voice was filled with madness and his eyes shone with a cruel light. He was clearly not a good person.</p><span class="QCRKFBWT">He was none other than the middle-aged man who was chasing after Qin Feng.</span><p id="RBRVEDGV">At this moment, he no longer dared to be careless. Instead, his face revealed a trace of shock and fear.</p><p id="IDWZGEHW">Black Stone Mountain was not the territory of the Revelation, and even the small town at the foot of the mountain did not belong to the Revelation. Of course, this place did not belong to Beichen or the Sky Martial.</p><div id="ONUUBLIN">In a short half a day, he had experienced the impressiveness of this Body Refinement Sixth Layer junior.</div><span class="JWGPXLDZ">Qin Feng's astonishing movement technique, powerful body, and keen perception … He was extremely afraid of both of them.</span><span id="ZNFUASYS">"What kind of cultivation technique did this kid train in?" "Why is my body so strong and that terrifying fist technique? Each and every one of my moves are filled with a tyrannical aura …"</span><span class="AHUIXJSA">Not only Xiao Jiu'an, even Ji Yunkai had noticed it, but there was more than one person lurking around, so they could not let down their guard and took action on their own.</span><span class="QCRKFBWT">The middle-aged man continued to ponder as the fear in his heart became even stronger.</span><div class="XQOQCCWN">In the Sky Martial Continent, everyone thought that the difference in strength would be like heaven and earth for a small realm.</div><span class="WMONOTXP">Chapter 567 - Reconciliation</span><div class="OBPZUAMA">But now, the middle-aged man actually had an extremely great doubt towards this sort of reasoning.</div><p class="BJTCULSC">They simply did not believe that there would be an army pressing down on their territory, and even more so, did not believe that the Revelation would spend such a huge amount of effort to take down such a barren land.</p><div class="XQOQCCWN">There was a full two small realms between the sixth and eighth level of the Body Refinement Realm. Logically speaking, he should be able to sweep Qin Feng away.</div><div class="FYTOPQMK">However, this was not the case!</div><span class="WIMYMDZX">Therefore, it was no wonder that Li Yuan met him, and did not connect him with the people from the Demon Sect. The seven disciples of the Demon Sect were all extremely ordinary, and looked like good people.</span><div id="OHFRZSHX">"No!" I must return as soon as possible and report to Young Master Lin Kai. "If I ruin the young master's great opportunity, then I won't be able to get anything good out of him. That kid is too monstrous!"</div><div id="WMWPICZB">"We don't care about her previous status, but now that she's the Holy Maiden of our Devil Sect, if Your Highness wants to touch her, we'll have to see if you agree or not." The people from the Demon Sect said arrogantly, obviously looking down on the Prince Yanbei Xiao Jiu'an.</div><div id="SHQBMHAP">As he thought about this, his killing intent began to dissipate. His body flashed and he fled in another direction.</div><span id="BIEUBSRM">"Bam!"</span><span class="WIMYMDZX">Therefore, it was no wonder that Li Yuan met him, and did not connect him with the people from the Demon Sect. The seven disciples of the Demon Sect were all extremely ordinary, and looked like good people.</span><div id="ONUUBLIN">Just as the middle-aged man moved, a powerful force broke through the air and charged towards him.</div><span class="DLTEJGDJ">The legends in the martial arts world said that Xiao Jiu'an would take revenge for her grievances. She was extremely petty, and what she said was not wrong at all.</span><span class="DOPOONQQ">The strong force caused the middle-aged man to be greatly shocked.</span><div class="VOMEUTWT">If someone could hide the Devil Sect's lair in the Black Stone Mountain for several years without it being discovered, she wouldn't believe that the Devil Sect hadn't tampered with the Black Stone Mountain.</div><span id="IFJLRTKA">Turning his head to look, he saw a youth flying into the air as he brandished his fist towards him.</span><p id="RBRVEDGV">There was a cold chill in the boy's eyes!</p><p class="PTPEMYAY">"Prince Yanbei, leave some room for yourself so that we can meet again in the future." The one that was beaten up by Xiao Jiu'an was the eldest out of the seven sons. Although he was angry, he had the face of a farmer.</p><div class="OBPZUAMA">Who else could it be other than Qin Feng!</div><div class="ELSMIHJW">Even the major sects in the martial arts world would not dare to go against the imperial government, let alone a mere Devil Sect. Against hundreds of thousands of the imperial government's regular army, even the most powerful experts would have to admit defeat.</div><p id="SZOLKJFB">"Damn it!"</p><div class="YKHZLUVL">The middle-aged man gnashed his teeth, not daring to fight back and hurriedly retreated backwards.</div><p id="EALENPUX">"Kid, die!"</p><p class="GBXPYHND">After dodging the attack, the middle-aged man stepped forward. His zhen Qi condensed into an illusionary poisonous snake as he rushed towards Qin Feng.</p><div id="MJLGQFBU">"Humph!"</div><p class="PDXRXSMX">Qin Feng snorted coldly. Without dodging, he charged at the middle-aged man with even greater speed.</p><span id="UWKNEPCA">"What kind of thing dares to negotiate with this King for a meeting in the future? Only your Sect Leader is qualified to bring this up in front of This King." Evidently, Xiao Jiu'an did not place these small fries in his eyes.</span><div class="JRDSVJJH">"Ground-shattering Godly Fist!"</div><p id="EALENPUX">Before the Qi had even arrived, the fist intent had already forced its way over.</p><p class="GBXPYHND">That shocking fist aura seemed to be able to shatter the earth, it was so powerful and majestic!</p><p id="IDWZGEHW">Black Stone Mountain was not the territory of the Revelation, and even the small town at the foot of the mountain did not belong to the Revelation. Of course, this place did not belong to Beichen or the Sky Martial.</p><p class="DMQSIJOE">Such a terrifying pressure instantly caused the middle-aged man to freeze, and his movements to become half a beat slower.</p><p id="SZOLKJFB">In a battle between martial artists, every step was cautious. The slightest flaw would allow the other party to grasp the opportunity.</p><p class="BJTCULSC">They simply did not believe that there would be an army pressing down on their territory, and even more so, did not believe that the Revelation would spend such a huge amount of effort to take down such a barren land.</p><span id="ZNFUASYS">"Break!"</span><span id="ASBFIGDB">"Prince Yanbei, don't force us to attack!" The boss had been beaten to the point of bleeding. He gritted his teeth in anger, but did not dare to make a move.</span><span class="QCRKFBWT">Qin Feng bellowed as boundless fist energy transformed into a boundless force that gushed out from his body.</span></body>
