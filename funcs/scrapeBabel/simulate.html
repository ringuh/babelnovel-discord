        <body><span id="AGSYDTMJ">Chapter 284 - Man-made Monitoring</span><div id="HKQWSPDL">With her current condition, she wouldn't be a match for Zhou Yuan at all. Of course, even if she completely recovered her Origin Qi and faced Zhou Yuan, who had broken through the limits of Divine Palace Stage, she wouldn't have any chance of winning either.</div><div id="OOHUMJRC">Training these profound techniques and techniques, every single one of them required too much brain cells, compared to those few hundred boxes, it was simply too easy. Originally, when Li Tian was a Sovereign, he had to avoid the surrounding hundreds of thousands of attacks, and in that situation, Li Tian could even dodge the attacks, let alone the hundreds of boxes.</div><div class="GYXYYDXQ">The only troublesome thing was that Li Tian had to be the first to enter every day, then be the last to leave every day, so that he could see the prices of those people.</div><span class="MWJCFBDN">Li Tian used his fastest speed to filter out over 400 stones. These over 400 stones all had spirit energy, and although the rest had a portion of spirit energy, they were just too thin, so there wasn't much of a use for them. Even if he bought all of them, it would just be piled there.</span><span class="CDBPUBEC">As Su Youwei looked at Wu Yao, whose body was on the verge of collapse, a trace of worry flashed across his eyes as he softly spoke.</span><p id="CNVZTTRZ">If Li Tian still had the power of a host god, he would have been able to split his consciousness for a long time. Not to mention monitoring these chests, even monitoring the movements of tens of billions of people wouldn't be a problem, but it was a pity that he didn't have a single cent of the original power at all. To be able to look at these several hundred chests was already very tiring for Li Tian.</p><p id="ZFKRYSOZ">Fortunately, the workload was slowly decreasing. As long as the value of one box exceeded the value of the jade, Li Tian would immediately choose to retreat, so that way, there would be no need for him to monitor the box anymore. On the first day, more than 30 boxes were abandoned by Li Tian.</p><span id="ORRUOWAK">"Zhou Yuan is also stealing the fortune from Wu Yao's body â€¦ What was going on? Does he also have the fortune of a Turtle? " However, even when Zhao Mushen was trying to devour Wu Yao's fortune, he did not see the latter die. How did he become like this upon meeting Zhou Yuan?</span><div class="FFIXDQZC">On the first day they strolled around, they saw most of the materials for the bet. The so-called "half bet" material meant that the window was open, and either there was already jade or there was no jade inside. The prices for the initial green had at least doubled, while the prices for the ones that didn't have jade were relatively lower.</div><p class="SHEJRKWX">She could feel that following the stripping of the Holy Dragon Fortune, her life force seemed to be flowing away as well. This made her understand that if Zhou Yuan took the last bit of Holy Dragon Fortune that was left in her body, she would most likely die along with it.</p><p id="EILSLCIA">Originally, he wanted to see that kind of explosive situation on the first day. Who knew that after Li Tian went in, he would sit at the side, moreover, going back so early every day. He returned so late that he even had to sit inside during lunch.</p><p id="HMDBJMTG">The moment she said that, she formed a seal with one hand, and in the next moment, her body started to shake violently, as though there was a sad and shrill cry sounding out, and another mysterious aura soared up from her head, turning into a dragon shadow and flying towards the dragon's mouth behind Zhou Yuan.</p><span class="XALFKIQX">When Li Tian was sitting inside, he didn't stop to chat with others, so others couldn't see anything special about Li Tian either. In these two days, there were quite a few people who came over to chat with Li Tian, including the Zheng siblings, but they didn't find anything wrong with Li Tian. After all, it was the same for Li Tian when the standards were set, and basically, he didn't go out.</span><span class="AYKLXSAR">Although Zheng Ruyan wanted to chat a little more with Li Tian, she was too busy these few days. Their Jewelry Company would warm up when they were at the public target level, and did not invest much money.</span><span class="IBPTDEZI">After all, if both sides were fighting to the death, then it would be alright, but under the current situation, Wu Yao obviously did not have the strength to fight, and if Zhou Yuan were to kill her in such a situation, it would be troublesome.</span><span class="DSTTMCTH">It was just like how Li Tian saw these ingredients, the spirit energy inside were all plentiful. The emerald was at least at the level of the Ice Seed, and there were a few that were at least at the Glass Seed Realm, so the size of the jade was not small. If someone bought it back, that would be a huge fortune for them, but with someone like Li Tian here, it would be really difficult for anyone else to earn money from it.</span><p class="IDWWYVGY">Zhou Yuan watched Wu Yao's pale white face indifferently, his eyes twinkling.</p><p id="PGZAHIDW">These few days, Li Tian did not stay idle and discussed with Zhou Daguo about the future Security Company. Currently, the Security Company was still under the Food and Drink Group and did not go out independently. Li Tian planned to leave the Security Company on his own after going back, so that he could recruit a large number of people.</p><div class="NBTPWJGP">Even Zhou Daguo felt that this was a waste of time, he should be able to let Li Tian go out and take a look at those ingredients. It would not be too late to take care of Security Company's matters when he return.</div><span id="MQCUOZSP">But Zhou Daguo was a worker, Li Tian was his boss, he would listen to whatever Li Tian wanted to say, and he was also in charge of Security Company, so Zhou Daguo was happy to see his territory expanded.</span><p id="CNVZTTRZ">Actually, Li Tian already had a direction in mind for the development prospects of the Security Company, and that was to develop into two parts. One part would be the elite security, while the other part would be the ordinary security, just like the Zhang Family in Hong Kong, where they would provide bodyguards to the rich and powerful people to collect a certain amount of profits. That was also one of the directions to development, and the profit was extremely huge.</p><p id="RTWNNBXP">It was the Saint Dragon phenomenon.</p><span class="MWJCFBDN">The development of normal security was very easy, as long as there was money, they could develop it, but if one wanted to develop elite security, then they would have to invest a lot of money into one aspect, and the other part was Li Tian's Divine Water, which made the most progress for Zhou Daguo, Yu Yangchun and the other two. Zhou Daguo had already reached the fourth stage of his cultivation, while Sun Rui and Yu Yangchun had already reached the Getting Started with the Three Sections, so if they wanted to become elite bodyguards, Getting Started with the Three Sections would probably only be a starting point.</span><p class="IDWWYVGY">Zhou Yuan watched Wu Yao's pale white face indifferently, his eyes twinkling.</p><p id="WQPLUQYZ">After dividing it with everyone, the company would be able to keep 500 thousand, and if they wanted to collect higher bodyguard fees, they would have to increase their own abilities. According to Li Tian's calculations, the fourth stage of the entrance would be able to earn the company around 700 thousand every year, while the fifth stage would be able to earn 1 million. Looking at the current fifth stage, it was already a watershed, and to continue developing it, other than the Divine Water, Li Tian had to create another set of techniques for them.</p><p id="VDCBZRZN">Thus, in the end, he had managed to rise up and turn the tides.</p><p id="ZFKRYSOZ">Towards the prospects that Li Tian was describing, Zhou Daguo felt that his blood was boiling. If his subordinates had over a hundred people with Getting Started with the Three Sections, then this Security Company would be as strong as them.</p><p id="PGZAHIDW">Zhou Daguo had calmed down very quickly. If he had not thought about it in the past, the growth of his skills had also caused his brain to become more rational, he knew that if he wanted to achieve this goal, he would need to go through a lot of development, at least for now, he did not have the ability to do so. The only thing he could help Li Tian was to find people, to find a few reliable people, and it would not be easy for him to nurture everyone.</p><div id="TEHNVXSZ">In Wu Yao's heart, there was no fear, instead, it was calm.</div><div class="GYXYYDXQ">After looking for four days like this, Li Tian still had 119 boxes under his control. The other ones all exceeded the price that Li Tian had estimated, and it wasn't impossible to buy them all, but it was hard to tell what the final result would be. After all, Li Tian didn't have a single eye, so he could only rely on spirit energy to guess.</div></body>
