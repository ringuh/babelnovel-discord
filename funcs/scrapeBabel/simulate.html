        <body><p class="WVRJMVWM">All of the Eclipse Insects that were still alive fled from the sea of flames and entered the secret realm.</p><div class="ZKPHHXVA">During this bumpy process, Lu Yishuang's hand accidentally separated from Li Qingcang's. The ocean water washed violently onto Lu Yishuang's body, the torrential downpour all over the sky, instantly turning her into a drowned chicken. Her face was completely soaked by the sea water, and her eyes were so agitated by the water that it was hard for her to open them. She could only hear the violent crackling sounds of the rain hitting the deck.</div><span id="SNXWDXVM">In front of the Snowy Region.</span><div id="OTMUBCIN">In the darkness before his eyes, Lu Yishuang suddenly fell to the ground again. Naturally, he was also incomparably terrified, but wherever his hands could reach, there was only ice-cold sea water. She immediately shouted out loud: "Li Qingcang, Li Qingcang, where are you!"</div><div class="NBUTREQJ">The clone of the Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior was also stunned by Great Honored Warrior Yin's words for a few seconds. Then, he used his bloodline's secret art to activate the special space ring with his soul.</div><p id="ICFQHUWM">To her, the only safe haven was Li Qingcang. With him around, no matter where she went, she was filled with a sense of security. And once she lost him, her world would begin to crumble little by little, eventually collapsing …</p><div id="JVNQAMTG">In the middle of the burning land, the boiling lava burned with raging flames. Suddenly, it converged into a river of flames, as if it had broken through layers of spatial barriers and entered a completely different realm.</div><span id="PVEHAJFH">Just then, another huge wave came, causing Lu Yishuang's entire body to be submerged in the ocean water. She endured the pain in her eyes and forced herself to open her eyes. She saw the deck that was soaked bright by the sea water, saw the fleeing crew members around them, heard the cries of fear, but she could not see Li Qingcang …</span><span id="ZEGEODQD">At this moment, her heart was floating up and down like a ship on the sea. She was always nervous and fearful, and it was unknown when she would suddenly be pushed to the bottom of the sea by the waves …</span><p id="OHNDTLMQ">"Li Qingcang, where are you?! Come out!"</p><div class="HSGDFLPD">One after another, streams of flame water began to fly out of the core of the formation that Nie Tian's Flame Sacred Domain had created.</div><p id="VCURNJSR">"Li Qingcang, Qing Cang, where are you! Come out quickly!"</p><div id="CWCBEVUI">Lu Yishuang roared twice, but when she looked around, he still could not see Li Qingcang's figure.</div><div class="YAXQILKF">Just as she was feeling a little disheartened, someone suddenly carried her from behind. She walked towards the cabin without a word, and said with a assured voice, "Don't worry, I'm here."</div><div id="SGAIOAGB">If one were to look at the Eclipse Insects' mouths that were larger and thicker, they would see that even an ordinary Spirit Channeling grade treasure would find it difficult to kill them.</div><div id="CWCBEVUI">The familiar force, the familiar temperature, and the familiar aura instantly enveloped her. Even though the waves were still wreaking havoc, even though the torrential rain was still hurting her body, her panicked and uneasy heart immediately calmed down. Looking up, she saw that it was indeed Li Qingcang.</div><span class="FJAAIWZW">Looking at his handsome face that was also drenched by the sea water, even though his body was very cold, there was still a warm feeling rising from her heart, causing her to instinctively stretch out her arms and embrace his neck.</span><p id="OHNDTLMQ">She knew that under no circumstances would he abandon her.</p><p id="LYQSQSOV">When all the people had entered the cabin, they were finally able to isolate the heavy rain outside.</p><div class="OUSTVBML">Even Nie Tian's original body, which was nine thousand meters tall, was covered in small insects before the eyes of the enormous beast.</div><p class="XHMWMHAH">However, the violent sounds of the rainstorm hitting the windows and the strong jolting of the ship still made everyone's heart lurch.</p><p class="GYHQBLGG">Li Qingcang had long since brought Lu Yishuang into the room.</p><div id="OTMUBCIN">The two of them, who were drenched from head to toe, were naturally shivering from the cold.</div><p class="SKLFFTPB">The Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior Yin Gu, the Vampiric Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior from Ethereal Opening, and the unknown Great Honored Warrior from the Jia Ruidao Realm appeared in front of the floating land.</p><span id="ECTMEVUZ">Lu Yishuang dried her eyes and was shocked to see that Li Qingcang, who was standing in front of him, did not have the slightest bit of elegance from before. He was completely drenched, and his beach clothes were all stuck on his body.</span><div id="JVNQAMTG">The secret soul art of the Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior could have threatened him, but with the help of the five Evil Gods, this clone of the Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior was unable to use the soul art to suppress or destroy his Flame Soul Division soul.</div><div id="CWCBEVUI">Even though she knew that the timing was inappropriate, she was still unable to hold it in. "Puchi!" She burst out in laughter.</div><div id="WONPHOAH">"Don't laugh." But the expression on Li Qingcang's face was extremely stern, and he rolled his eyes at her.</div><p id="AWAXPJOP">Extreme Flame Star Domain, Fire Continent.</p><span id="TCUTXHDW">The feeling of being mocked by her was truly rather unpleasant.</span><span class="UXFMHKRX">"Oh, I got it. I'm not laughing …" Lu Yishuang could only forcefully hold back his laughter, and shot him an embarrassed glance. Seeing that he still had a straight face, she immediately comforted him, "Don't be like this, it's all in the past anyway. This brightly lit room was truly comfortable! I'm going to take a hot bath right now! "</span><span id="LKMLAPFN">A while later, a grey bone flew out from the chest area of Great Honored Warrior Yin.</span><p id="LYQSQSOV">But as soon as she entered the bathroom, all the lights in the entire boat went out with a snap.</p><div id="JVNQAMTG">In the middle of the burning land, the boiling lava burned with raging flames. Suddenly, it converged into a river of flames, as if it had broken through layers of spatial barriers and entered a completely different realm.</div><div id="CWCBEVUI">"AHH!" Of course, Lu Yishuang couldn't get used to this sudden darkness. She let out an instinctive scream and quickly left the bathroom, "How can I be so unlucky!"</div><p class="GYHQBLGG">Without the lights, it was dark at night. He couldn't even see his fingers. Lu Yishuang turned on the phone, borrowing the faint light from the screen, she was barely able to see everything in the room.</p><p class="SKLFFTPB">The Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior Yin Gu, the Vampiric Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior from Ethereal Opening, and the unknown Great Honored Warrior from the Jia Ruidao Realm appeared in front of the floating land.</p><p id="JVTECJIA">Then, Li Qingcang received a call from the vice-captain.</p><p id="ILDJCILB">"What, a short circuit, not being able to fix it in a short period of time?" When can the electricity... Get ashore to recover? "Alright …"</p><div class="PJAHYYUM">After hanging up the phone, Li Qingcang frowned, as though he was displeased. But when he saw Lu Yishuang who was not far away, her eyebrows immediately relaxed. "Don't worry, it's just a short circuit, it's just not convenient to fix it right now. "But the hot water is gone …"</div><div class="RGJYOPHX">The terrifying body of the enormous beast that had been torn apart finally flew out of the ground bit by bit.</div><span class="UXFMHKRX">"Puff!" Just that, before he finished speaking, Lu Yishuang had sneezed fiercely.</span><span id="IDHEAIYB">"Aooo!"</span><span class="MKARLPAG">When Li Qingcang saw this, his heart ached and he immediately warned: "Change your wet clothes first, so you don't catch a cold."</span><div class="OUSTVBML">Even Nie Tian's original body, which was nine thousand meters tall, was covered in small insects before the eyes of the enormous beast.</div><span id="MLGEBJYH">However, Lu Yishuang was in a bit of a dilemma: "I never thought that something like this would happen, so I didn't bring my clothes with me …"</span><p class="WVRJMVWM">He felt incomparably carefree.</p><span id="QYDMBRCY">Her words did remind Li Qingcang. He didn't bring any clothes...</span><div class="SAOGVJVQ">"Then …" Under the extreme helplessness, Li Qingcang could only quietly say, "Then let's take off our clothes, dry our bodies, and lie on the bed."</div><p id="PIWFJLVO">The Great Honored Warriors from the Ruins Realm, Bloodthirsty Great Honored Warrior and Great Honored Warrior Ethereal Opening Realm were also dazed for a moment when they saw the sudden appearance of the raging flames.</p><span id="ECTMEVUZ">This... Although it was true that it was much more comfortable to dry your body and lie down on your bed to cover yourself, but when these words came out of your mouth, how come it was somehow a little dirty?</span><span id="PVEHAJFH">"Hurry up and take it off, or you'll really catch a cold." Li Qingcang, on the other hand, did not say anything further. He took off his clothes, took out a towel from the cabinet, and dried his body.</span><p class="SKLFFTPB">The Thousand Souls Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior Yin Gu, the Vampiric Great Honored Warrior, Great Honored Warrior from Ethereal Opening, and the unknown Great Honored Warrior from the Jia Ruidao Realm appeared in front of the floating land.</p><p class="GYHQBLGG">Then, perhaps he did it on purpose, he exposed his bare upper body, leaning against the headboard with his strong arms behind his head, waiting for her with interest.</p><p class="XKYSFIOO">His gaze made Lu Yishuang a little embarrassed, but the wetness and sticky feeling of being cold also made her feel a little uncomfortable. After some thought, she turned off the phone, hid in the dark, took off her wet clothes, dried her body, and got into bed.</p><span class="OULMWMMM">The enormous beast that had revealed its true appearance wasn't far from the Snowy Region of Soaring Sky. It and the enormous beast looked like a snow-white ball of light when they flew together.</span><p id="LYQSQSOV">At this point, the heavy rain outside the window finally stopped, and the sea surface gradually calmed down. However, there were still some waves that caused the entire ship to move up and down slightly. It was even a bit strange and romantic.</p><span id="PVEHAJFH">Lu Yishuang and Li Qingcang laid on the bed. There was no electricity, and everything was dark except for the faint light of the moon coming in through the window. Both of them seemed bored.</span><span class="GJEQHOHT">"Qing Cang, it was all thanks to you just now. Otherwise, I would have been smacked into the ocean long ago." Lu Yishuang suddenly said, her voice was filled with gratitude.</span><p id="PIWFJLVO">The Great Honored Warriors from the Ruins Realm, Bloodthirsty Great Honored Warrior and Great Honored Warrior Ethereal Opening Realm were also dazed for a moment when they saw the sudden appearance of the raging flames.</p><div id="IWEFAFTL">"I said that no matter when or where, I will protect you and not let you get injured." Li Qingcang's tone, seemed to be as if it was a matter of course, "However, you're too naive. You don't even know where to hide when the waves come? Are you just sitting there waiting to be swept away? "</div><div id="KKLNYGRV">Lu Yishuang heard the disgust in his words and was somewhat unhappy. She could not help but reach out and pinch his waist ruthlessly, "I was just scared silly at that time. After all, I've never encountered such a thing … "I told you to despise me, to despise me …"</div></body>
